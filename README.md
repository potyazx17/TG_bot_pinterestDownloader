# TG_bot_pinterestDownloader

The TG_bot_pinterestDownloader project is a Telegram bot written in Python that allows users to download images (and possibly videos) from Pinterest using links provided in the chat. The main goal of this bot is to simplify the process of retrieving media content from Pinterest directly within Telegram.

Key features of the project may include:

- Accepting Pinterest post links from Telegram users.
- Downloading images (and possibly videos) from these links.
- Sending the downloaded files back to the user in the chat.
- Using libraries for working with the Telegram Bot API (such as python-telegram-bot or pyTelegramBotAPI).
- Handling errors and supporting different link formats.
